# Student-Management-System

# Inspiration
Having recently learned PostgreSQL, I wanted to apply my skills in a real-world project, building on my Java experience to deepen my knowledge of database management. This project combines my existing Java skills with SQL, allowing me to explore the integration of backend and database technologies.

# What it does
This project implements a secure login system in Java with PostgreSQL as the database. Users input their login credentials via the terminal, where Java processes and validates the data before saving it to a PostgreSQL database table. The focus is on secure storage and efficient data handling, demonstrating integration between Java and PostgreSQL for effective user authentication, data storage, and retrieval. This project is ideal for applications needing a reliable and scalable user credential management system.
